# Usage Guide for CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML

## Getting Your Data Ready

1. **Prepare your CSV file** with the test execution data. Ensure it has columns for TestID, TestName, ExecutionTime, and Result. Example format:

    ```csv
    TestID,TestName,ExecutionTime,Result
    1,LoginTest,0.5,Pass
    2,LogoutTest,0.35,Fail
    3,DataFetchTest,0.4,Pass
    ```

    Save this file in the `data` directory.

## Running the Analysis

2. **Execute the analysis script** with your CSV file by running:

    ```bash
    python src/classify_flakiness.py data/your_test_data.csv
    ```

    This command analyzes your test data, appending a `Flakiness` column to indicate potential flakiness.

## Visualizing the Results

3. **For detailed visualization**, open the Jupyter notebook provided:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/flakiness_analysis.ipynb
    ```

    Run all cells in the notebook to visualize your test data analysis.

## Understanding Your Analysis

- The output CSV and Jupyter notebook visuals will help categorize your tests, showing which might be flaky.
- Use this information to target improvements in your testing process.

For more detailed customization or to add new data sources, you can modify the `classify_flakiness.py` script and the Jupyter notebook as needed.
