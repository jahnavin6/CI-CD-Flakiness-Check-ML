# CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML

`CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML` offers a solution to identify and analyze flaky tests within Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. By applying machine learning and statistical analysis, it aims to uncover patterns in test executions, helping teams improve the reliability and efficiency of their testing processes.

## Key Features

- **Data-Driven Analysis:** Utilizes test execution data to pinpoint flaky tests.
- **Machine Learning Insights:** Employs predictive models to forecast test outcomes and identify flakiness indicators.
- **Visualization Tools:** Provides graphical representations of test data and analysis, facilitating intuitive understanding of test performance.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML.git
cd CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML

# Install required dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter

# Analyze your test data
python src/classify_flakiness.py data/your_test_data.csv

# Explore analysis results visually
jupyter notebook notebooks/flakiness_analysis.ipynb

# Verify the setup with tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
## Handling Edge Cases

When utilizing `CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML`, it's crucial to anticipate and manage edge cases to ensure accurate analysis and functionality:

- **Incomplete Data**: Verify that all CSV files are complete and correctly formatted. Incomplete or improperly formatted data can significantly affect analysis accuracy. Utilize data validation scripts if necessary to pre-check files before analysis.

- **Large Datasets**: Analysis of extensive datasets may increase processing time. Consider preprocessing steps to pare down data to essential test executions or utilize incremental analysis methods to manage large volumes of data efficiently.

- **Environment Variability**: The environment where tests are executed can influence flakiness. Document and consider the execution environment during analysis, especially if tests are known to behave differently across various environments.

## Extending the Tool

`CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML` is built with extensibility in mind, allowing for adaptation and growth as your project's needs evolve:

- **Incorporating New Data Sources**: To accommodate different data formats or sources, you can extend or modify the data ingestion module. This flexibility allows the tool to evolve alongside your data collection strategies.

- **Updating the Machine Learning Model**: The predictive model at the heart of `CI-CD-Flakiness-Check-ML` can be updated, retrained, or replaced to enhance its predictive accuracy or to reflect new insights as more data becomes available. Explore integrating newer machine learning algorithms or techniques for improved performance.

- **Customization for Specific CI/CD Pipelines**: Depending on the CI/CD tools and practices in use, you may need to customize the analysis and reporting features of the tool. This customization can involve adapting the tool to different test result formats or integrating with CI/CD platforms for automated analysis.
